			<p>Past and Future</p>

			<h2>My Background</h2>
			<p class ="change">A majority of my career has been in the arts, specifically within the dance world. I have made the plunge into development and couldn't be more excited. I graduated from Rutgers University in 2013 with a BFA in Dance, and since then I've been and aerialist and dancer for Royal Caribbean, being able to travel to many parts of the world. Aside from dancing in a few dance companies in New York City, I also had the opportunity to co-direct and choreograph and show in Brazil which has been a huge sucess since March 2016.</p>

			<h2>Going Forward</h2>
			<p class ="change">I believe my visual skills and problem-solving abilities in my previous work as a choreographer are going to serve me extremely well as a web developer, allowing me to be able to think critically about the issues at hand as well as design visually and aesthetically pleasing work.</p>
